ACID_SLIME_L,"Large acid slime that clogs your deck with Slimed cards and splits into two medium slimes at half HP.","Corrosive Spit: single attack that adds Slimed to your deck; Lick: applies Weak; Tackle: heavier single attack; Split: divides into two Acid Slime (M) when at or below half HP.","Try to push it from above 50% HP to death or to the split threshold in one big turn so the medium slimes spawn with low HP; include exhaust or card draw to clear Slimed cards and block Tackle turns."
ACID_SLIME_M,"Medium acid slime that also splits and fills your deck with Slimed cards.","Corrosive Spit: attack that adds Slimed; Lick: applies Weak; Tackle: medium hit; Split: divides into two Acid Slime (S) at half HP.","Plan your damage so it splits when you can immediately clean up the small slimes; keep your deck flowing so Slimed cards do not completely stall your hand."
ACID_SLIME_S,"Small acid slime that mostly annoys you with Slimed cards and chip damage.","Corrosive Spit or Tackle: small attacks plus Slimed; Lick: Weak on higher difficulties.","Focus them down quickly so Slimed does not snowball; cheap AoE and exhaust effects are great to delete both the slime and the junk it creates."
SPIKE_SLIME_L,"Large spiky slime that inflicts Vulnerable and can split into two medium Spike Slimes at low HP.","Tackle: single heavy attack; Lick: applies Vulnerable; Split: splits into two Spike Slime (M) at or below half HP.","Try not to let it split while you are Vulnerable; either burst it down from above half HP or delay damage until after debuff turns so you can safely handle the offspring."
SPIKE_SLIME_M,"Medium spiky slime that applies Vulnerable and can split into smaller Spike Slimes.","Tackle: moderate attack; Lick: applies Vulnerable; Split: splits into two Spike Slime (S) when low HP.","Avoid taking big hits while Vulnerable; time the split so you are ready with AoE and enough Block."
SPIKE_SLIME_S,"Small spiky slime that mainly adds Vulnerable and small damage.","Tackle: small attack; Lick: small Vulnerable application depending on ascension.","They are very fragile; remove them early so later elites do not find you at low HP because of repeated Vulnerable."
CULTIST,"A bird-like fanatic found in Act 1.","Starts with 'Incantation' to gain Ritual (strength per turn), then attacks repeatedly.","This is a damage race. Kill it quickly before its Strength scales too high."
JAW_WORM,"A common Act 1 enemy with a hard shell.","Cycles between Chomp (high damage), Thrash (damage + block), and Bellow (strength + block).","It generates significant Block. attack when it buffs, block when it attacks. Don't underestimate its burst damage."
RED_LOUSE,"Small Act 1 parasitic creature.","Buffs its own Strength (Grow) and attacks. Can curl up for Block on hit.","Kill in one hit if possible to bypass Curl Up. If it buffs Strength, prioritize killing it immediately."
GREEN_LOUSE,"Small Act 1 parasitic creature.","Applies Weak debuff and attacks. Can curl up for Block on hit.","Less dangerous than the Red Louse, but the Weak debuff is annoying. Clear it after high-threat targets."
LOOTER,"A thief found in Act 1 and 2.","Attacks to steal gold, then attempts to flee.","Frontload damage to kill him before he escapes with your gold. If he flees, the gold is lost."
BLUE_SLAVER,"A slaver minion found in Act 1 and Act 2.","Stabs for damage and applies Weak.","Often appears with other enemies. Prioritize him if you rely on attack damage, as the Weak debuff is detrimental."
FUNGI_BEAST,"A mushroom creature found in Act 1.","Buffs Strength and attacks. On death, applies Vulnerable to the player (if Spore Cloud is active).","Kill quickly. Be aware that killing it might apply Vulnerable, making remaining enemies more dangerous for a few turns."
GREMLIN_NOB,"Act 1 Elite. A large, angry goblin.","Buffs itself with Enrage (gains Strength whenever you play a Skill), then attacks heavily.","Do not play Skills (Defend, etc.) unless absolutely necessary to survive. Race him with pure Attack cards."
LAGAVULIN,"Act 1 Elite. A sleeping shell creature.","Sleeps for 3 turns. Upon waking, reduces your Strength/Dexterity significantly, then attacks heavily.","Spend the first 3 turns setting up Powers. Once he wakes, burst him down before the debuffs make you ineffective."
SENTRY,"Act 1 Elite. A trio of floating automatons.","They alternate between attacking and shuffling 'Dazed' cards into your draw pile.","Kill one of the outer Sentries first to reduce incoming damage. Area of Effect (AOE) attacks are very strong here."
THE_GUARDIAN,"Act 1 Boss. A giant construct.","Shifts between Offensive Mode (attacks) and Defensive Mode (gains thorns/block). Shifts to defensive after taking a damage threshold.","Math is key. Deal enough damage to trigger Defensive Mode before he launches his big attack. So keep eyes on \"Mode Shift\" status on GUARDIAN, the value is the minimal damage to change the Mode. Force it to change mode can avoid big damage from him. Don't attack him while he has sharp thorns unless you have lethal."
HEXAGHOST,"Act 1 Boss. A multi-limbed ghost.","Damage scales based on your current HP (Divider). Uses multi-hits and adds Burn cards to your deck.","Fighting at low HP reduces his opening damage. Kill him quickly before the Burns clog your deck and he uses 'Inferno'."
SLIME_BOSS,"Act 1 Boss. A giant slime.","Attacks and slams. Splits into two smaller slimes when HP reaches 50%.","Bring his HP to just above 50%, then hit him with your biggest attack to make the split versions start with much lower HP."
BYRD,"Flying birds found in Act 2.","Flying grants 50% damage reduction. Attacks multiple times (pecks).","Multi-hit attacks are best. hitting them 3-4 times in a turn knocks them to the ground, removing their defense and stunning them."
SPHERIC_GUARDIAN,"Act 2 enemy. A floating ball.","Starts with Artifact and Barricade. continually gains Block and deals damage.","Use high damage attacks to break through his Block. Debuffs work only after stripping Artifact charges."
CHOSEN,"Act 2 enemy. A bird cultist.","Applies 'Hex' (shuffles Dazed into deck when you play non-attacks) and hits hard.","Avoid playing non-attack cards when Hexed if possible. Burst him down to prevent deck pollution."
SHELLED_PARASITE,"Act 2 enemy. A parasite in a shell.","Has Plated Armor (blocks every turn, reduces when taken damage). Attacks and debuffs.","You must deal constant damage to reduce the Plated Armor stack. Do not play passive turns."
SNAKE_PLANT,"Act 2 enemy. A plant with a snake head.","Has 'Malleable' (gains Block whenever it takes damage). hits hard and applies Frail/Weak.","Use single large hits rather than many small hits to avoid stacking its Malleable block excessively."
SNECKO,"Act 2 enemy. A chaotic serpent.","Applies 'Confused' (randomizes card costs) and attacks.","Confusion is RNG. Prioritize playing high-cost cards that become cheap. Ignore low-impact cards."
CENTURION,"Act 2 enemy. An armored knight.","Often appears with a Mystic. Defends and attacks.","Kill the Mystic (healer) first. The Centurion is tanky but predictable."
MYSTIC,"Act 2 enemy. A healer.","Heals the Centurion and buffs Strength.","Kill immediately. If left alive, she will prolong the fight and buff the Centurion's damage significantly."
GREMLIN_LEADER,"Act 2 Elite. Calls minions.","Summons Gremlins, buffs them, and attacks.","Prioritize killing the minions (Gremlins). If no minions are alive, the Leader is forced to summon instead of attacking you."
BOOK_OF_STABBING,"Act 2 Elite. A floating book.","Multi-attacks that hit more times each turn. Shuffles wounds into your deck.","This is a DPS check. You must kill it fast. Strength-reducing cards (like Disarm) are extremely effective against its multi-hits."
TASKMASTER,"Act 2 Elite (Slavers).","Buffs Strength of all slavers and hits hard.","Part of the Slaver trio. Usually the last target, as the Red Slaver (Entangle) and Blue Slaver (Weak) are higher threats."
RED_SLAVER,"Act 2 Elite (Slavers).","Uses 'Entangle' (prevents you from playing Attacks next turn).","Kill him FIRST. Entangle is a run-ending debuff."
BRONZE_AUTOMATON,"Act 2 Boss. A robot.","Summons minions, buffs strength, and uses 'Hyperbeam' (massive damage).","Kill the minions to get your stolen cards back. Save full block or intangible potions for the Hyperbeam turn."
THE_CHAMP,"Act 2 Boss. A gladiator.","stances (defensive/offensive). At 50% HP, he purges debuffs and uses 'Execute' (huge damage).","Scale your defense or strength slowly. Don't push him below 50% HP until you are ready to kill him in 1-2 turns to avoid Execute."
THE_COLLECTOR,"Act 2 Boss. A necromancer.","Summons minions, applies massive debuffs (Mega Debuff), and attacks.","AOE is crucial to clear minions. Focus the boss when minions are down. Save an Artifact potion to block the Mega Debuff."
DARKLING,"Act 3 enemy. Dark blobs.","When killed, they revive after a timer if others are still alive.","Bring all of them to low HP, then kill them all in the same turn to prevent respawning."
ORB_WALKER,"Act 3 enemy. A walking shape.","Gains Strength every turn and attacks. Also adds Burns to deck.","A pure damage race. Scale faster than him or die."
SPIRE_GROWTH,"Act 3 enemy. A tentacle beast.","Applies 'Constricted' (damage at end of turn) and hits very hard.","Kill quickly. The Constricted damage is unblockable and adds up fast."
TRANSIENT,"Act 3 enemy. A fading shadow.","Has 999 HP. Attacks for huge damage but loses Strength equal to damage taken that turn. Fades away after 5 turns.","You don't usually kill it (unless you have infinite damage). Just deal enough damage every turn to reduce its attack to 0/manageable levels."
THE_MAW,"Act 3 enemy. A giant mouth.","Increased HP. Buffs strength and applies Frail/Weak.","A tanky enemy. Ensure your block engine is running, as the fight will go long."
WRITHING_MASS,"Act 3 enemy. A shifting tangle.","Changes its intent (attack/block/debuff/curse) whenever it takes attack damage.","Hit it until it lands on a benign intent (like a small block or non-attack), then stop attacking for the turn. Don't end turn while it intends a Parasite."
GIANT_HEAD,"Act 3 Elite. A stone head.","Counts down 5 turns ('It is time...'), then deals massive damage repeatedly. Applies Slow (take more damage per card played).","Play as many cards as possible to utilize the Slow debuff (increases your damage). You must kill it before turn 5 ends."
NEMESIS,"Act 3 Elite. A ghost with a scythe.","Alternates between 'Intangible' (takes 1 damage) and vulnerable. Adds Burns to deck.","Set up your powers/draw during his Intangible turns. Unleash all burst damage on the turns he is tangible."
REPTOMANCER,"Act 3 Elite. A snake summoner.","Summons daggers. Daggers attack and explode for huge damage.","Kill the Daggers immediately. AOE is essential. Do not ignore the daggers or you will take massive damage."
TIME_EATER,"Act 3 Boss. A clock-headed slug.","Forces turn end after you play 12 cards. Gains Strength every time this triggers. Resets to 50% HP once.","Watch the counter. Never end your turn on 10 or 11 cards played. Play high-impact cards only. Don't spam low-value Shivs/Cantrips."
AWAKENED_ONE,"Act 3 Boss. A bird cultist.","Gains Strength whenever you play a Power card. Revives once with higher damage.","Avoid playing non-essential Powers in Phase 1. Kill the two cultists first. Unleash powers in Phase 2."
DECA,"Act 3 Boss (Donu & Deca). Diamond shape.","Grants Block to both monsters and adds Dazed to your deck.","Kill Donu first. Ignore Deca until Donu is dead, but keep an eye on your deck filling with Dazed."
DONU,"Act 3 Boss (Donu & Deca). Circle shape.","Buffs Strength for both monsters and attacks.","Kill Donu first. Removing the source of Strength scaling makes Deca much easier to manage."
CORRUPT_HEART,"Act 4 Boss. The heart of the spire.","Caps damage taken per turn. Beats of Death (deal 1x15 damage every time you play a card). Multi-attacks and huge single hits.","You need a deck that can block while attacking (passive block). Apply Weak constantly. Save potions for the first cycle of attacks."
DAGGER,"Summoned by Reptomancer, Daggers often have Explode-style attacks that deal big damage if not killed.","","Strong AoE is the best answer—kill Daggers the turn they appear whenever possible. Do not let the board reach four Daggers unless you are about to wipe them. If your deck lacks AoE, focus a single Dagger to prevent Explode damage and use targeted removal plus Block."
EXPLODER, "Bomb-like enemy that counts down to a large explosion if not destroyed in time.","Small attacks or idle turns; a countdown buff that triggers an explosion for big damage when it reaches zero.","Always track its countdown; kill it before the explosion turn or have a massive Block turn ready; in groups, you may need to divert damage from elites or other threats to remove Exploder safely."
FAT_GREMLIN,"Chunky gremlin that mostly defends and applies mild debuffs instead of dealing big damage.","Minor attacks; Block-oriented moves; occasional Weak or other small debuffs.","Generally lowest priority; you can leave it for last while you focus on higher damage threats, but do not ignore status buildup if the fight drags on."
GREMLIN_WIZARD,"Extremely dangerous gremlin that charges up a massive hit after a few turns.","Charge moves that telegraph a coming huge attack; final blast that deals very high damage in a single turn.","Almost always make this your top priority; use potions or burst damage to kill or heavily weaken it before the big hit goes off; if killing it is impossible, plan your strongest Block turn for the charged attack."
MAD_GREMLIN,"Aggressive gremlin that likes to hit multiple times for modest damage total.","Multi-hit attack (2 - 4 small hits); occasional small Block or idle turns on some difficulties.","When combined with other attackers it can produce large combined damage; Weak and small amounts of Block on multiple turns are efficient answers."
REPULSOR,"Floating enemy with low direct damage that pollutes your deck with Dazed cards.","Light attacks; moves that add multiple Dazed cards into your draw pile; sometimes blocks lightly.","In long fights, Dazed accumulation makes drawing answers difficult; use exhaust and card draw or simply kill Repulsor early if your deck struggles with status cards."
ROMEO,"Leader of the Masked Bandits trio in the Act 2 event. He opens by mocking you, then alternates between hard hits and weakening slashes that make the rest of the fight much more dangerous.","Mock: first-turn move that deals no damage but starts his pattern; Agonizing Slash: single-target attack that deals solid damage and applies multiple turns of Weak; Cross Slash: heavier single-target attack with no debuff, used on alternating turns after Agonizing Slash.","If you cannot kill Bear on turn 1, Romeo is often the next best focus because his Weak makes it harder to block both Bear and Pointy in later turns. Try to kill either Bear or Romeo within the first two turns of the fight. Plan your Block so that an Agonizing Slash turn does not line up with Bear's biggest attack, and once Romeo is down, the remaining two bandits are much easier to manage."
SPIRE_SHIELD,"Act 4 elite that appears together with Spire Spear. Shield is the defensive half, granting large Block and punishing you with Strength or Focus reduction depending on your character","Bash: deals moderate damage and reduces Strength or Focus; Fortify: gives a large Block amount to both Shield and Spear; Smash: big hit that also grants Shield Block equal to damage dealt, scaling further at high Ascension.","In most decks you should kill Spear first, because Shield’s Block becomes much less threatening once the main damage source is gone. Bring artifact strip and Block-breaking tools (Piercing Wail, Disarm, cards that ignore Block, etc.). Avoid letting Smash create absurd Block stacks—Weak and Strength-down help a lot. Positioning/orientation rules mean you should not get trapped taking hits from behind if you can avoid it."
SPIRE_SPEAR,"Act 4 elite partner to Spire Shield. Spear handles the bulk of the damage with multi-hit attacks and Strength buffs, while also adding Burn cards that tax your Block and HP.","Burn Strike: multi-hit attack that adds Burns; Skewer: large multi-hit attack with 3–4 hits; Piercer: buffs Strength for both elites.","Treat Spear as the primary kill target; the longer it lives, the more Strength and Burns accumulate. Weak and Strength-down are extremely powerful against its multi-hit attacks. Remove or exhaust Burns where possible to keep hands clean. Plan potions and defensive spikes for Skewer turns, which can easily be lethal on higher Ascensions."
TORCH_HEAD,"A minion found in The Collector boss fight (Act 2).","Buffs The Collector's Strength and attacks.","Generally, you can ignore them if you have high burst damage for the Boss. However, if the fight drags on, kill them to stop the Boss's strength from scaling too high."
BEAR,"Part of the Red Mask Gang (Bandits) in Act 2. The large tanky bandit.","Uses 'Bear Hug' to reduce your Dexterity (permanent for the fight) and deals damage.","The Dexterity debuff is dangerous, but his partner (Pointy) deals more immediate damage. Usually kill Pointy first, then finish Bear."
BRONZE_ORB,"A minion summoned by the Bronze Automaton (Act 2 Boss).","Uses 'Stasis' to steal a card from your deck (usually a high rarity one) and hold it. Also attacks.","Kill immediately. Upon death, it returns the stolen card to your hand. Leaving it alive denies you your best cards."
SHIELD_GREMLIN,"A Gremlin holding a shield, found in Act 1 and 2.","Uses 'Protect' to give large amounts of Block to other monsters. Attacks weakly.","Kill him if his guarding prevents you from killing high-threat targets (like Wizard Gremlins). Otherwise, save him for last as his damage is low."
SNEAKY_GREMLIN,"A Gremlin with a dagger, found in Act 1 and 2.","Attacks for high damage relative to its low HP.","A glass cannon. Kill him immediately to mitigate incoming damage. He is usually a top priority in Gremlin gangs."
SPIKER,"A geometric shape enemy found in Act 3.","Starts with Thorns and continually buffs to increase Thorns.","Do not use multi-hit attacks (like Twin Strike or Pummel), or you will kill yourself on the thorns. Use single high-damage hits or indirect damage (Poison/Orbs)."
MUGGER,"A blue-clad thief found in Act 1 and 2.","Attacks to steal gold ('Mug'), then attempts to flee after a few turns.","Burst him down quickly to save your gold. If he escapes, the stolen gold is lost forever."
POINTY,"Part of the Red Mask Gang (Bandits) in Act 2. The blonde bandit with a scythe.","Deals multi-hit damage and applies Vulnerable.","Kill him first in the Bandit encounter. The Vulnerable debuff makes the other bandit (Bear) much more dangerous."
